### Project Goal
We want an interface for us to be able to read participants applications from and to easily make and store our decisions to accept/reject/waitlist an applicant. Ideally, this would be able to read a communal excel file (or just hook directly into our registration system) and then display applicants response to application questions in a nice interface.
